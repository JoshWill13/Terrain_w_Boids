# Terrain_w_Boids

The projects goal was to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds over top of terrain generated by perlin noise.
A shader has been created for the terrain and some animation has been done to the boids(seagulls) to add some 
realism.

The boids are controlled by collision avoidance, group allingment, group cohesiveness, and are directed to 
follow the RedArrow. The RedArrow itself follows a spline of selected points. Inside Unity both terrain
and flocking setttings can be altered.

Controls for camera:

A = Pan left
D = Pan right
W = Tilt up
S = Tilt down
R = Raise Camera
F = Lower Camera
Arrow Keys = moving the camera left, right, forward, and backward
Z = triggers the predator boid to lock onto a seagull and attack
